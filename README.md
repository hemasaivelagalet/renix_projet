### Project Overview

The Emergency Preparedness Chatbot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide timely and relevant information to users preparing for or responding to various emergencies. It uses advanced machine learning models and a FAISS index to offer efficient, context-aware responses. The chatbot is developed using FastAPI (or Gradio) and can be hosted locally or on a cloud platform.

### Features and functionalities

    Contextual Awareness: Maintains conversation history to provide responses relevant to previous user queries.
    Efficient Information Retrieval: Uses FAISS indexing to quickly retrieve information from an emergency preparedness dataset.
    Conversational Interface: Access the chatbot through a REST API (FastAPI) or a user-friendly Gradio web interface.
    Robust Search: Supports similarity-based retrieval of information on topics like flood preparation, earthquake safety, and fire response.
     
### Setup Instructions

  1.Clone the Repository
  
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/emergency-preparedness-chatbot.git 
    cd emergency-preparedness-chatbot
  2.Set Up a Virtual Environment
  
    python -m venv venv 
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate  

  3.Install Dependencies
  
    Install the required packages listed in requirements.txt: 
    pip install -r requirements.txt     

4. Download or Load the Dataset

       Ensure you have the emergency_preparedness_data.csv dataset with the Content and Filename columns. Place it in the project directory.

5. Generate and Save the FAISS Index
   
       If the FAISS index is not already created, run the following script:
       python create_embeddings.py

This will generate embeddings for the dataset and save the FAISS index as faiss_index.bin.
Configuration

Ensure the following configuration variables are set in your environment if needed:

    MODEL_PATH: Path to the language model (if fine-tuned or customized).
    API_KEY (optional): API key for any third-party integrations.

### Usage Guide
Running the Chatbot with FastAPI

  Start the FastAPI server:

    uvicorn main:app --reload
 Access the API documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to interact with the chatbot using the /query/ endpoint.

Running the Chatbot with Gradio (Optional)

 Start the query interface

    python python query_interface.py
 A local web interface will open, where you can interact with the chatbot directly.

Example Queries

    User: "How do I prepare for an earthquake?"
    Chatbot: "To prepare for an earthquake, secure heavy items, create a family plan, and keep emergency kits ready. Would you like more detailed steps?"

### Testing
Manual Testing

    Use the FastAPI documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs to test API responses.
    For Gradio, enter queries directly in the interface to verify chatbot responses.

Automated Testing (Optional)

For more rigorous testing, consider writing tests using the pytest framework. Sample tests could include checking if responses are returned within a reasonable time and verifying that the chatbot maintains conversation context.
### Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this project, please follow these steps:

    Fork the repository.
    Create a new branch for your feature (git checkout -b feature-name).
    Commit your changes (git commit -m "Add feature").
    Push to the branch (git push origin feature-name).
    Open a Pull Request.

For deployment, consider hosting the chatbot on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud, which support FastAPI applications. Gradio also offers a quick deployment option using Gradio’s shareable links if you’re running the chatbot locally.
